She says
Love love, my lovely love
I'll smother her, so we can be together
Forever and ever and ever forever
Till it's over and done
It's done, it's done

She says
It wouldn't be fair
Not to heed the warning
Since nothings getting in the way
Of our love forming
She'll sink, sink, into the water
Nothings going to stop my love
You're so pretty as boiling blood
My Love

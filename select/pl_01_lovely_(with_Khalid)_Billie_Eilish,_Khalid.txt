Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out
But you never go away
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh I hope someday I’ll make it
out of here
Even if it takes all night or a
hundred years
Need a place to hide but I
can’t find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I
can’t fight my fear
Isn’t it lovely?
All alone
Heart made of glass
My mind of stone
Tear me to pieces
Skin to bone
Hello,
Welcome home.
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place
Something’s on my mind
Always in my head space
but I know someday I’ll make it
out of here
Even if it takes all night or a
hundred years
Need a place to hide but I
can’t find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I
can’t fight my fear
Isn’t it lovely?
All alone
Heart made of glass
My mind of stone
Tear me to pieces
Skin to bone
Hello,
Welcome home.
Hello,
Welcome home.
